    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
            <p>Programming languages are the foundation of software engineering. They are tools that allow developers to communicate instructions to computers. Learning a programming language is the first step towards becoming a software engineer.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Java Fundamentals</a>: Dive into the basics of Java programming language, including variables, data types, control structures, and functions.</li>
                <li><a href="#">Python Basics</a>: Learn the fundamentals of Python programming language, covering topics such as data types, loops, functions, and file handling.</li>
                <li><a href="#">JavaScript Essentials</a>: Explore the core concepts of JavaScript, including variables, functions, objects, and DOM manipulation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <h3>Data Structures & Algorithms</h3>
            <p>Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and software engineering. They provide efficient ways to store and manipulate data, as well as solve computational problems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Introduction to Data Structures</a>: Learn about various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, along with their applications and implementations.</li>
                <li><a href="#">Algorithms and Problem Solving</a>: Explore algorithm design techniques such as greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and divide-and-conquer, and apply them to solve various problems.</li>
                <li><a href="#">Advanced Data Structures</a>: Dive deeper into advanced data structures such as graphs, heaps, and hash tables, and understand their use cases and implementations.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <h3>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h3>
            <p>Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Object-Oriented Programming with Java</a>: Learn the principles of OOP, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, using Java as the primary language.</li>
                <li><a href="#">Python Object-Oriented Programming</a>: Explore how to create and work with classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism in Python, a versatile and easy-to-learn language.</li>
                <li><a href="#">JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming</a>: Understand how to implement OOP concepts such as objects, classes, inheritance, and encapsulation in JavaScript, a widely used language for web development.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <h3>Version Control and Collaboration</h3>
            <p>Version control systems are essential tools for managing changes to source code over time. They allow developers to track modifications, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others effectively.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Git Essentials</a>: Learn the basics of Git version control system, including creating repositories, committing changes, branching, merging, and collaborating with others using platforms like GitHub and Bitbucket.</li>
                <li><a href="#">Advanced Git Topics</a>: Explore advanced Git topics such as rebasing, resolving merge conflicts, managing large repositories, and integrating Git into your workflow effectively.</li>
            </ul>
