    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">The essential skills every mobile developer must have.</h4>
    <p>These days there are a large set of tools available for building mobile apps. But these tools fall into two categories: native and cross-platform tools.</p>
    <p>With native tools, you can build apps for a specific problem (eg iOS or Android). Each platform has its own programming languages and tools. So to target multiple platforms, you have to learn many tools and write code in different languages.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, you can use a cross-platform solution (eg React Native or Flutter) to build apps for multiple platforms using a single codebase.</p>

    <h5 class="mb-3">JavaScript</h5>
    <p>JavaScript is the language of the web. It is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. As a mobile developer, having a solid understanding of JavaScript is essential.</p>

        <li><a href="#">Advanced JavaScript Concepts</a> - Dive deeper into JavaScript with this course covering advanced topics like closures, prototypes, and async programming.</li>
        <li><a href="#">TypeScript Crash Course</a> - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="mb-3">React</h5>
    <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. Here are some recommended courses to learn React:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">React for Beginners</a> - Learn the basics of React and how to build simple React applications.</li>
        <li><a href="#">Intermediate React Concepts</a> - Dive deeper into React with this course covering topics like state management, hooks, and context.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="mb-3">React Native</h5>
    <p>React Native is a framework for building native mobile apps using JavaScript and React. Here are some recommended courses to learn React Native:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">React Native Fundamentals</a> - Learn the fundamentals of React Native and how to build mobile apps for iOS and Android.</li>
        <li><a href="#">Advanced React Native Concepts</a> - Dive deeper into React Native with this course covering advanced topics like navigation, animations, and performance optimization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="mb-3">Version Control and Collaboration</h5>
    <p>Version control is like a time machine for software engineers. It allows you to go back in time and see the exact state of your code at any point. This is incredibly important because it means you can easily track changes, fix bugs, and collaborate with others without the fear of losing or messing up your code.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Git and GitHub for Beginners</a> - Learn the basics of version control with Git and how to collaborate with others using GitHub.</li>
    </ul>
